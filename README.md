ðŸ“„ Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React-Bootstrap. It showcases my front-end development skills, projects, and professional experiences, while integrating modern web design principles and technologies.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
React: Front-end JavaScript library for building the UI.
React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef): For managing component state and side effects.
React-Bootstrap: For building responsive UI components.
JavaScript (ES6): For dynamic interactions.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the layout.

ðŸš€ Features

1. Component-Based Architecture
React Components: The entire portfolio is built using a modular, component-based architecture. This allows for reusability and easier maintenance, as each section (e.g., navbar, home, about, contact) is a separate React component.

2. State Management with useState
I used the useState hook to handle dynamic state changes in the UI. For example, the light/dark theme toggle is managed using useState, which updates the theme based on the userâ€™s choice. When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the affected components.

3. Side Effects with useEffect
useEffect hook is used to manage side effects like handling scroll animations and event listeners. For example, I used useEffect to detect the scroll position and trigger animations or changes in the navigation bar as the user navigates through different sections of the portfolio.

4. Referencing DOM Elements with useRef
The useRef hook was employed to reference DOM elements directly, such as specific sections of the page. This was particularly useful for implementing smooth scrolling to different sections of the portfolio when users click on navigation links.

5. Responsive Design
React-Bootstrap and CSS media queries were used to ensure the website adapts perfectly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). The layout is fully responsive, ensuring the best user experience across all devices.

6. Dynamic Light/Dark Theme
Users can switch between light and dark themes, which is implemented using the useState hook to toggle the appropriate CSS classes dynamically. This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to personalize the appearance of the site.

7. Interactive UI with React-Bootstrap
To improve the user interface, I used React-Bootstrap components such as buttons, modals, and navbars. These pre-styled components enabled a clean and intuitive design while saving development time.

8. Optimized for Performance
The website is optimized for speed and performance, with careful attention to clean, modular code. Features such as lazy-loading images and reducing unnecessary re-renders were implemented to enhance the site's efficiency.
